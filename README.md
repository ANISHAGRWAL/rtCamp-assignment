# XKCD Comic Email Subscription System

This project is a PHP-based web application that allows users to subscribe to a mailing list to receive a random XKCD comic in their inbox every day. It features a secure email verification system for both subscribing and unsubscribing, and it uses a CRON job for automated daily emails.

This project was developed as a part of the placement assignment for **rtCamp**.

A daily dose of humor delivered right to the inbox.


## ‚ú® Features

  * üìß **Two-Step Email Verification:** Users subscribe by entering their email and confirming with a 6-digit code sent to their inbox. This ensures a secure and validated subscriber list.
  * ü§£ **Daily Random XKCD Comic:** A CRON job runs automatically every 24 hours to fetch a new random XKCD comic and send it to all registered subscribers.
  * üëã **Verified Unsubscribe:** Users can easily and securely unsubscribe through a link in the email, which also requires a verification code to prevent accidental removal.
  * üìÑ **File-Based "Database":** All subscriber emails are stored and managed in a simple `registered_emails.txt` file, adhering to the project requirements of not using a traditional database.
  * ü§ñ **Automated CRON Job Setup:** Includes a `setup_cron.sh` script that automatically configures the system's crontab to run the daily email script.
  * üåê **Resilient Comic Fetching:** The system uses PHP cURL to fetch comic data from the XKCD API and includes a fallback to `file_get_contents` to ensure reliability.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  * A local web server environment (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP)
  * PHP (Version 8.3 recommended)
  * A local email testing tool like [Mailpit](https://mailpit.axllent.org/) to capture and view outgoing emails.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ANISHAGRWAL/rtCamp-assignment.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```sh
    cd src
    ```

3.  **Place the project** in your local server's web root (e.g., `htdocs` in XAMPP).

4.  **Configure Email Testing:**

      * Set up Mailpit or a similar tool.
      * Configure your `php.ini` file to use the mail-catching tool by setting the `sendmail_path`.

5.  **Set up the CRON Job:**

      * Open your terminal in the `src` directory.
      * Make the setup script executable:
        ```sh
        chmod +x setup_cron.sh
        ```
      * Run the script to automatically add the daily task to your system's crontab:
        ```sh
        ./setup_cron.sh
        ```

    This will schedule `cron.php` to run every day at 9:00 AM. Logs will be stored in `cron.log`.

6.  **Start Subscribing\!**

      * Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/your-project-folder/src/`.
      * Enter your email, receive the verification code in Mailpit, and complete your subscription.
